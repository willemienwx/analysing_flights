Task:
- make (public) github repository called "Analysing Flights"
- add a Rmd file including R code to: 
    - load the nycflights13 package
    - clean up the feature columns ready for modelling
    - use functionality from a tidymodels package to split the data into a traning sample and a test sample
    
The aim is to ensure that the student is ready for building models by demonstrating she/he can use techniques and code learned in Book 1 and Book 2 and other tutorials.

```{r loading required libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)
library(tidymodels)
library(nycflights13)
```
